	<h1> Justin Mireles</h1>
	
		<p> I am a 31 year old graphic design major and have been at ACC for 3 years. I ,however, do not live in Austin, I live in a small town called Rockdale, about an hour away from here. I also work at Hobby Lobby in Round Rock, and have been there for th past five years.</p>
	

		<p>I have a 2 year old english bulldog named "Chancho". Some of my hobbies include drawing, playing video games, and watching anime. To feed my nerd culture addiction, I also enjoy going to comic cons.</p>
